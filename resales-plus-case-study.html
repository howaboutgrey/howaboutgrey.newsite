          <h5 class="heading-4">1. Understanding</h5>
          <div class="content-container">
            <h5 class="heading-4">Challenge</h5>
            <p class="paragraph-2">Resales Plus was built upon a legacy platform that had accumulated over two decades of features and functionalities. However, <strong class="bold-text">the existing Information Architecture (IA) lacked clarity</strong>, leading to a cluttered experience where <strong class="bold-text">users struggled to find what they needed</strong>. The platform had too many features with unclear objectives, resulting in a <strong class="bold-text">complex and confusing user experience</strong>. <br><br>Additionally, many features were poorly designed and not user-friendly, making it <strong class="bold-text">difficult for users to complete essential tasks efficiently</strong>. The lack of usability improvements over the years meant that several features had become obsolete or underutilized. More critically, there was <strong class="bold-text">no clear understanding of the core user goals and pain points</strong>, making it challenging to implement meaningful design improvements.</p>
            <div class="card horizontal">
              <div>How might I help stakeholders see the impact of a design thinking approach?</div>

            <h5 class="heading-4">Approach</h5>
            <p class="paragraph-2">To address these challenges, I began by conducting a <strong class="bold-text">comprehensive product audit</strong>, evaluating each feature’s purpose, usability, and relevance. This helped us identify redundant or ineffective functionalities that could be streamlined or eliminated. To gain deeper insights, we <strong class="bold-text">conducted UX research, including quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews</strong>, engaging real estate professionals to understand their primary needs, pain points, and expectations.<br><br>Following our research, we facilitated <strong class="bold-text">collaborative workshops with stakeholders</strong> to redefine the Information Architecture (IA) and user flow. Through iterative brainstorming sessions, we <strong class="bold-text">identified and prioritized core features</strong>, ensuring they were both useful and accessible. This process was followed by the <strong class="bold-text">development of wireframes, high-fidelity prototypes, and interactive mockups</strong>, which were continuously refined based on user feedback. </p>

            <p class="paragraph-2">We conducted user surveys to collect feedback from existing users, focusing on identifying their biggest challenges and most frequently used features. <strong class="bold-text">Through this research, we found that the Dashboard and Search functionalities were the most critical areas requiring improvement</strong>. The Dashboard lacked clear data visualization and workflow efficiency, while the Search experience was hindered by complex filtering options and an outdated interface. </p><img src="images/Screenshot-2025-02-01-at-17.51.36-3-1.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 92vw, (max-width: 991px) 87vw, 840px" srcset="images/Screenshot-2025-02-01-at-17.51.36-3-1-p-500.png 500w, images/Screenshot-2025-02-01-at-17.51.36-3-1-p-800.png 800w, images/Screenshot-2025-02-01-at-17.51.36-3-1-p-1080.png 1080w, images/Screenshot-2025-02-01-at-17.51.36-3-1-p-1600.png 1600w, images/Screenshot-2025-02-01-at-17.51.36-3-1-p-2000.png 2000w, images/Screenshot-2025-02-01-at-17.51.36-3-1.png 2230w" alt="">

            <p class="paragraph-2">Once identified the primary focus areas, I conducted <strong class="bold-text">collaborative brainstorming workshops with stakeholders, product managers, and engineers</strong>. These sessions were instrumental in restructuring the information architecture and redesigning user flows, by using white boarding techniques and UX mapping tools such as FigJam. We also <strong class="bold-text">prioritized feature development based on feasibility and user impact</strong>, ensuring that the redesign addressed both business goals and user needs.</p><img src="images/Screenshot-2025-02-01-at-17.51.36-4.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 92vw, (max-width: 991px) 87vw, 840px" srcset="images/Screenshot-2025-02-01-at-17.51.36-4-p-500.png 500w, images/Screenshot-2025-02-01-at-17.51.36-4-p-800.png 800w, images/Screenshot-2025-02-01-at-17.51.36-4-p-1080.png 1080w, images/Screenshot-2025-02-01-at-17.51.36-4-p-1600.png 1600w, images/Screenshot-2025-02-01-at-17.51.36-4-p-2000.png 2000w, images/Screenshot-2025-02-01-at-17.51.36-4.png 2230w" alt="">
            <h5 class="heading-4">Wireframing &amp; High-Fidelity Design</h5>
            <p class="paragraph-2">With a clear direction established, I started designing wireframes in Figma, focusing on the restructured Dashboard and Search experience. <strong class="bold-text">Low-fidelity wireframes were shared with internal teams for early feedback</strong>, allowing us to refine layouts and workflows before progressing to high-fidelity designs.
